# Network Infrastructure Project

## üìå Overview
This project is a simulation of an **enterprise network infrastructure** built using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It demonstrates the design, implementation, and configuration of a secure and scalable network across multiple locations:

- **Location A**
- **Location B**
- **Remote Branch**

The topology includes routers, multilayer switches, VLAN segmentation, firewalls, wireless controllers, access points, and servers to provide **end-to-end connectivity and security**.

## ‚ú® Features

### üîπ Multi-location Network
- Location A and Location B connected via multiple routers.  
- Remote branch office integrated into the core topology.  

### üîπ Routing & Switching
- Static and dynamic routing between networks.  
- VLAN segmentation for different departments.  
- Inter-VLAN routing with multilayer switches.  

### üîπ Security
- Host-based firewall installed on end-user PCs.  
- Network-based firewall between core routers and servers.  

### üîπ Wireless Network
- Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) managing Lightweight Access Points.  
- Wireless VLANs for mobile devices and laptops.  

### üîπ Servers
- Main server for internal services (DHCP, DNS, Applications).  
- Additional servers at Location B for redundancy.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use
1. Open the file `PROJECT.pkt` in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
2. Switch to **Simulation Mode** to test connectivity.  
3. Verify:  
   - Inter-VLAN communication.  
   - Firewall filtering.  
   - Wireless device connectivity.  
   - End-to-end ping between Location A, Location B, and Remote Branch PCs.

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Add VPN connectivity for remote users.  
- Configure advanced security features (ACLs, IDS/IPS).  
- Implement load balancing between servers.  
- Introduce QoS for VoIP traffic.
